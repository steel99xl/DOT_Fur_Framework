A Custom Exploit Framework for Furries

##INSTALLATION##
Run the
run.sh
file to have it determine what dependencies you need for the main framework


###SUMMARY###
	The (DOT)Fur Framework is a framework system similar to the metasploit framework, but it is intended to run as peer to peer rather than by a company.

	The framework supports "Sparkles" (plugins/extensions) that any user can write and, as an example, for each supported language that is included, in-depth documentation can be found in the"Documentation" folder along with documentation for the custom scripting language known as "Fur Script".

	This scripting language is designed to be used alongside the (DOT)Fur Framework when writing, the limitations of the language mainly comedown to what Sparkles you have available. The scripting language supports exporting so that it can be run on any Unix/Linux system. This is so you don't need to have the whole framework installed on the system if you just want to run the scripts.
The export is set to create as little files as possible so that you might have multiple languages in the same exported script. More documentation can be found in "Documentation/Fur_Script"
