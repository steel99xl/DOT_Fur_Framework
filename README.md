###SUMMERY###
The (DOT)Fur Framework is a framework system that is similar to the metsploite
framework but is intended to be peer to peer rather than run by a company.
The framework supports "Sparkles" (plugins/extensions) that any user can write, and example
for each supported language is included, in depth documentation can be found in the
"Documentation" folder along with documentation for the custom scripting language
known as "Fur Script" this scripting language is designed to be used along side
the (DOT)Fur Framework when writing, the limitations of the language mainly come
down to what Sparkles you have available. The scripting language supports exporting
so it can be run on any unix/linux system with. this is so you don't have to have
the hole framework on the system just to run the scripts, The export is set to make
as little files as possible so you might have multiple languages in one exported
script. More documentation can be found in "Documentation/Fur_Script".
